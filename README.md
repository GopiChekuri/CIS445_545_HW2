# CIS445_545_HW2: Web Application Development Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the coursework for CIS 445/545 at Bradley University. It focuses on web application development, emphasizing the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side technologies. The application showcases various web development concepts including form handling, dynamic content generation, and responsive design.

## Features
- **Responsive Web Design**: The application is designed to be mobile-friendly with a responsive layout.
- **Form Handling**: Users can input data into forms, which is processed and displayed dynamically.
- **Client-Side Interactivity**: JavaScript is used for form validation, dynamic content loading, and improving the user experience.
- **Styling**: CSS is used to style the web pages and create an engaging user interface.
- **Server-Side Logic (if applicable)**: Depending on the specific implementation, this project may include PHP or another backend technology for form submission and data handling.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and form validation.
- **Server-Side Technology (if applicable)**: To handle data submission and processing.

## Setup and Installation
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GopiChekuri/CIS445_545_HW2.git
    ```

2. Open the project folder and launch the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. For server-side functionality (if included), ensure you have a local server running (e.g., XAMPP or WAMP for PHP) and place the project files in the appropriate directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

## Usage
- Navigate to the main page by opening `index.html`.
- Interact with the form elements, provide inputs, and view the dynamically generated results.
- If server-side processing is included, follow instructions within the web app for submitting forms and viewing responses.

## Screenshots
(Add screenshots of the project if available to showcase the design and functionality.)

## Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced features like authentication, database integration, or API consumption.
- Improve the UI/UX by adding animations or more advanced layouts.
